# Activity_Selection
Activity selection using Greedy Algorithm.
Problem statement:
Two person , Alice and Bob, has to finished work on the basis of time scheduling.
There is one condition they should not override each other work.
For Example:
{(5,9),(1,2),(3,4),(0,6),(5,7),(8,9)}
(5,9) where first is starting time i.e. 5 and 9 is finishing time.
Now , if Alice try to finished the job with optimial time, than he can go like (1,2),(3,4),(5,7),(8,9)- 4 jobs
and Bob can go next and finished like (5,9)- jobs
again Alice will go foe (0,6)- 1jobs
5 jobs by Alice and one job done by Bob.
if, alice >bob-alice win or bob>alice - bob win, if both finished same number of job than it will be tie.
